    "answer": "Traumatic cataract results from physical, mechanical, or chemical trauma to the eye and is classified into three main types:\\n\\n1. **Concussion (Blunt Ocular Trauma) Cataract**:\\n   - **Mechanism**: Shockwaves propagate through the fluids without direct capsular rupture.\\n   - **Appearance**: Classically causes a ==\"Rosette-shaped\" / star-shaped cataract (MCQ)== in the posterior cortex, following suture lines.\\n   - ==Vossius Ring (MCQ)==: Pathognomonic dark ring of iris pigment deposited on the anterior lens capsule, created when mechanical force drives the pupillary iris rim against the lens.\\n\\n2. **Perforating / Penetrating Trauma Cataract**:\\n   - **Mechanism**: Direct mechanical rupture of the lens capsule, exposing lens proteins to aqueous.\\n   - **Presentation**: Rapid hydration and focal swelling of lens fibers. If the capsular tear is large, hydrated cortex leaks into the AC, clogging the trabecular meshwork to evoke acute ==Phacolytic Glaucoma (MCQ)== or phacoanaphylactic uveitis. Requires emergency lensectomy.\\n\\n3. **Physical/Radiation Cataracts**:\\n   - ==Infra-Red Radiation (Glass Blower\\'s Cataract) (MCQ)==: Prolonged exposure to heat rays induces splits and exfoliation of the anterior lens capsule.\\n   - **Ionizing Radiation**: Posterior subcapsular opacity forming after a significant latent period.\\n   - **Electrical Cataract** (Lightning/high-voltage shock): Features rapid-onset subcapsular lens opacities.",

    "answer": "Lens displacement occurs when there is complete or partial rupture of the suspensory ligament (zonules of Zinn) that anchors the lens in place behind the pupil:\\n\\n1. **Clinical Types**:\\n   - ==Subluxation (Partial) (MCQ)==: The lens is tilted or shifted away from the visual axis but remains partially within the pupillary aperture because only some of the zonular fibers are torn. Clinical findings include ==iridodonesis (tremulous iris) (MCQ)==, ==phacodonesis (tremulous lens) (MCQ)==, an uneven/deep anterior chamber, and ==uniocular diplopia (MCQ)== (due to light refracting simultaneously through the lens edge and the aphakic gap).\\n   - ==Dislocation (Complete) (MCQ)==: The lens is completely free of all zonular attachments and is displaced entirely out of the pupillary aperture.\\n     * ==Anterior Dislocation (MCQ)==: The lens slips forward into the anterior chamber, where it blocks aqueous flow through the pupil, triggering excruciating secondary ==pupillary-block glaucoma (MCQ)== and corneal endothelial failure. Requires immediate emergency operational extraction.\\n     * ==Posterior Dislocation (MCQ)==: The lens sinks backward into the vitreous cavity. The patient presents with symptoms of aphakia, and the yellow/white lens can be seen lying on the retina.\\n\\n2. **Principal Causes**:\\n   - **Ocular Trauma**: The most common cause. Severe blunt mechanical trauma tears the zonules.\\n   - **Hereditary / Congenital Disorders**:\\n     * ==Marfan Syndrome (MCQ)==: Classically causes bilateral, symmetrical ==superotemporal (upward-and-outward) lens subluxation (MCQ)==.\\n     * ==Homocystinuria (MCQ)==: Classically causes bilateral ==inferonasal (downward-and-inward) lens subluxation (MCQ)==, due to cysteine metabolic error causing unstable zonules; prone to thromboembolic episodes.\\n     * ==Weill-Marchesani Syndrome (MCQ)==: Causes ==microspherophakia (small, round lens) (MCQ)== with anterior lens subluxation.\\n   - **Acquired Zonular Weakness**: Chronic hypermature cataract, severe high myopia, or pseudoexfoliation syndrome (PXF).",

Thus, the patient maintains excellent central vision ==(6/6 visual acuity) (MCQ)== until the final, end-stages of the disease.\n   - Because the visual field loss begins in the mid-periphery and spreads insidiously, the brain constantly interpolates the missing zones.
